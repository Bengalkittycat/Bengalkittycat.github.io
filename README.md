# go_to_sleep
First web page I made as part of the CS50 week 8 problem set

Simple webpage with advice on getting better sleep. 
Straightforward CSS, simple JS functions like dark mode button or popup that shows up after 60 seconds

Kind of responsive.
Could use better paddings/margins.

Copy and image edits by me.
